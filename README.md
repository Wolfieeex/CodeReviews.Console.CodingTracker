# Coding Tracker
## Brief Documentation
### What is coding tracker?
The Coding Tracker is the ultimate productivity companion for devs who want some insight into their workflow. Built on a simple Create–Read–Update–Delete (CRUD) model, it gives you total control over every programming session you log. Start the built‑in timer when you dive into your code, or add sessions manually if you prefer. Then, whenever you need to amend an entry, for example, updating the number of lines you wrote, you can edit it in seconds. When it’s time to reflect, the Tracker’s reports lay out your past work in an easy-to-read format, helping you identify patterns, spot weaknesses, and plan your future steps. And if an old record no longer serves you, just remove it. This is your database, and so your rules.

On top of session logging, Coding Tracker helps you stay focused on your goals. Set milestones for your projects, and watch as each new coding session automatically brings you closer to, or warns you of, upcoming deadlines. When you’re approaching completion, you’ll get a heads‑up. If circumstances change, simply remove any goal you no longer need. No matter how your projects evolve, Coding Tracker keeps your planning as dynamic as your development.

### Features
1) #### Session injection- adding coding session manually 
   * This menu allows you to record a session that you didn't track using built-in timer. Before proceeding, mandatory fields, which are the starting and end date of the session, need to be filled in. The number of lines and additional comments are optional fields, but are recommended to be filled-in. This will ensure that all data is crystal-clear and ready to be reviewed in future.
   * All fields have appropriate data validation, forcing user to input data in specific formats. Thanks to this, all data is consistent and there are no surpises while dealing with a database. All fields can be updated and their value can be removed. The program also prevents user from inserting their session if start date occurs later than the end date.
   * After programming session is added, it will start existing in the database. One think to note is that inserting session manually will not update user's goals.

2) #### Session timer tracking
   * This feature lets you start the timer while you start programming. Big timer will be displayed on the middle of the console counting seconds. You can pause it whenever it fits you.
   * The programming session can be also discarted if no longer needed.
   * When you finish your coding for the day, you must insert the number of lines and comments for your session. Then a new record will appear in your database.
3) #### Goal features
   * You can insert new Goals to your database and decide whether you want to track how many coding lines you procudes or how much time you spent on programming in a given time frame. You can also choose deadline for your target.
   * If you need to view your previous goals, whether they are failed, completed or in progress, you can render a data table for them containing all vital information. The history of your previous goals can be deleted, if no longer needed.
   * There will be time, when you will no longer need to track a certain goal. Simply delete it using feature in goal menu.
4) #### Filtering
   * In certain situations user will have to
