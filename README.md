# Coding Tracker
## Brief Documentation
### What is coding tracker?
The Coding Tracker is the ultimate productivity companion for devs who want some insight into their workflow. Built on a simple Create–Read–Update–Delete (CRUD) model, it gives you total control over every programming session you log. Start the built‑in timer when you dive into your code, or add sessions manually if you prefer. Then, whenever you need to amend an entry, for example, updating the number of lines you wrote, you can edit it in seconds. When it’s time to reflect, the Tracker’s reports lay out your past work in an easy-to-read format, helping you identify patterns, spot weaknesses, and plan your future steps. And if an old record no longer serves you, just remove it. This is your database, and so your rules.

On top of session logging, Coding Tracker helps you stay focused on your goals. Set milestones for your projects, and watch as each new coding session automatically brings you closer to, or warns you of, upcoming deadlines. When you’re approaching completion, you’ll get a heads‑up. If circumstances change, simply remove any goal you no longer need. No matter how your projects evolve, Coding Tracker keeps your planning as dynamic as your development.
